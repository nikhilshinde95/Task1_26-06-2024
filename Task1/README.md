# Reverse Words in a File

## Description
This Java program reads a text file (`input.txt`), reverses each word in the file while preserving punctuation at the end of the words, and writes the output to another text file (`output.txt`).

# Instructions
1. Place your input text in a file named `input.txt` in the same directory as the `ReverseWords.java` file.
2. Compile the Java program:
    javac ReverseWords.java

3. Run the Java program:
    java ReverseWords
    
4. The reversed words will be written to `output.txt` in the same directory.

## Logging
- The program logs its actions using `java.util.logging`.
- Log messages are printed to the console.

## Test Cases
- Simple test cases for the `reverseWord` method are included in the `main` method.
- Run the program to verify the output of the test cases.

## Exception Handling
- The program includes exception handling for file operations.
- Errors are logged using `java.util.logging`.

## Example
### Input (`input.txt`):
```
My name is Yogesh.
This is a test file.
Hello, World! this
```

### Output (`output.txt`):
```
yM eman si hsegoY.
